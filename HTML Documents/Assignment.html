	<h1>Bacteria and viruses are cool!</h1>
	<h3>Let's learn about them.</h3>

	<p> When we look closely at the microscopic world around us there are many agents that can cause disease. It is important to know how they work and how to categorize them so that we may better understand them and apply this knowledge to the field of medicine. </p>
	<p> Here is a quote from Encyclopedia Britannica:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/science/microbiology">
	The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities.
